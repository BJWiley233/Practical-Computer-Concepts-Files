Task create python, perl or R script to parse Scoremat.asn file from PSI-BLAST:

pssm_viewer.cgi 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/Structure/pssm/pssm_viewer.cgi

Hi Brian,

Unfortunately I donâ€™t know how pssm_viewer.cgi does the mapping (perhaps info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov may be able to direct you to someone who knows), but the order of amino acids is listed in the array NCBISTDAA_TO_AMINOACID (see definition below).

I hope this helps, regards,
